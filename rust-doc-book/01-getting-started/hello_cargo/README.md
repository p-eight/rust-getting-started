# Cargo is Rust’s build system and package manager.

## To create a new project use: 
    
    *cargo new* project_name

## To build the project, there are three options:

    *cargo build* - creates an executable file in target/debug/project_name
    
    *cargo run* - compile the code and then run the resulting executable all in one command
    
    *cargo check* - quickly checks your code to make sure it compiles but doesn’t produce an executable

## To build as release use:

    *cargo build --release*
